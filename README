System Requirements
-------------------
* Sopha requires PHP 5.2.0 and up in order to run - the latest stable version 
  of PHP 5.2.x is recommended. Currently Sopha is not tested on other versions 
  of PHP. 

* While Sopha should work on any system capable of runnign PHP, it is currently
  only tested on Linux. Users of other operating systems should report any bugs
  if encountered. 

* Sopha does not require any non-standard PHP extension or INI setting in order
  work. If you encounter any issues, please report it along with the output of
  phpinfo() from your system. 

* You obviously need a CouchDb server installed in order to use Sopha. It 
  doesn't do much except for connecting to CouchDb ;)

Installation
------------
Since Sopha is fully implemented in PHP, there is not much installation needed.

Assuming you downloaded Sopha, simply add the Sopha library/ directory to your
PHP include_path and restart your server (if you use a web server). 

You can also copy the entire library/Sopha directory as is into your include
path (sometimes at /usr/share/php or /usr/include/php). 

Once this is done you simply need to include or require Sopha into your 
scripts, or just use autoload instead.

Acknowledgements
----------------
Sopha is a mere interface to CouchDb - a phenomenal piece of free software.
Credit goes to the main contibutors of CouchDb - namely Damien Katz, Jan 
Lenhardt, Christopher Lenz and Noah Slater - as well as many others.

The CouchDb project is an Apache Incubator project, and can be found at 
http://incubator.apache.org/couchdb/

Some of the code in Sopha, namely the part handling JSON, was adapted from
Zend Framework - a high-quality framework for PHP 5.x led by Zend Technologies.
